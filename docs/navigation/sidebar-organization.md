## Design Considerations

- Consistent spacing between groups
- Visual separators between sections
- Icons for quick visual recognition

2. Related features grouped together
3. Settings and system tools at the bottom
4. Clear visual distinction between sections

### Navigation Flow
- Follows natural workflow progression
- Primary work tools easily accessible
- Secondary features in logical groups
- System tools easily findable but not prominent

## Implementation Notes

- Use consistent padding and margins
- Clear visual separation between groups
- Hover and active states for all items
- Responsive design considerations

### Accessibility
- Clear heading structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast for text and icons

## Future Considerations

### Scalability

- Groups can be expanded as needed
- Maintains organization as app grows

### Customization
- Potential for user-customizable order
- Collapsible sections
- Favorites or quick access section
- Role-based navigation items

## Feedback and Iterations

The navigation structure should be regularly reviewed based on:
1. User feedback and behavior
2. New feature additions
3. Usage analytics
4. Accessibility requirements

## Migration Plan
