These are placeholder files for notification sounds. You should replace them with actual sound files:

1. notification.mp3 - Default notification sound
2. subtle.mp3 - Subtle notification sound
3. success.mp3 - Success notification sound
4. error.mp3 - Error notification sound

Sound files should be:
- Short (0.5-2 seconds)
- MP3 format
- Small file size (< 100KB)
- Appropriate volume levels
- Clear and distinct from each other
- Professional and not distracting

You can find suitable notification sounds from:
1. Free sound libraries
2. Sound effect marketplaces
3. UI sound packs
4. Your own custom recordings

Remember to verify licensing and attribution requirements for any sounds you use.
